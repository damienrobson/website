          I've recently relaunched my website (you've probably noticed, you're
          reading it). It's been needed as my previous efforts fell by the
          wayside and were just too big of an undertaking. This time I've gone
          completely back to basics. It's written from the ground up in raw HTML
          and CSS (that's right, there's not even a sliver of JavaScript). It's
          hosted on GitHub pages. I've wired it up with a custom domain, too,
          something I've never done before.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond that, I'm now fully-ingrained as a Digital Accessibility
          Specialist, and it's been one of the best decisions I've made in
          recent years. I've started hobbyist game development again (also
          taking a back-to-basics approach there) and had a clean up of my
          GitHub repo to get rid of the chaff that I know has served a purpose
          and that I won't be returning to.

        <h3>What's a "now" page...?</h3>
        <p>
          A <strong>Now</strong> page is designed to inform people of what you
          are up to, well, now. The concept was popularized by programmer and
          author
          <a
            href="https://sive.rs/"
            target="_blank"
            aria-label="Derek Sivers' website (opens in a new tab)"
            >Derek Sivers</a
          >
          in 2015. The concept came about as a quick way to answer the
          commonly-asked question, "What are you up to these days?".
