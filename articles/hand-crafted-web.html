        <p>
          For years, my digital portfolio has lived in the "black box" of
          frameworks. I've chased dependencies, wrestled with build tools, and
          watched my <code>node_modules</code> folders grow larger than the
          actual content I was trying to share.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a developer and an <strong>Accessibility Specialist</strong>, I
          finally reached a breaking point. I realised that the more "help" I
          was getting from modern web tooling, the further I was getting from
          the core DNA of the web, and the lazier I was becoming. Here is why I
          decided to strip everything back to raw HTML and CSS for this
          iteration of my website.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Accessibility by Intent, Not by Plugin</h3>
        <p>
          In my professional life, I see how easily frameworks can "break" the
          web for users with disabilities. When you use a heavy library, you're
          often fighting its default behaviours to make it accessible. By
          writing raw HTML, I am forced to be intentional. I'm not "fixing" a
          div to act like a button; I'm just using a
          <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. There is a semantic purity in
          hand-crafted code that ensures a screen reader user hears exactly what
          I intended.
        </p>

        <h3>2. The "Forever" File</h3>
        <p>
          Frameworks have a shelf life. If I build a site in the "Framework of
          the Year", I am effectively putting an expiration date on my content.
          In five years, that framework may be deprecated and the build will
          likely fail. A standard <code>.html</code> file is effectively
          immortal. I want this site to be just as readable in 2046 as it is
          today.
        </p>

        <h3>3. The Performance of Less</h3>
        <p>
          Most modern websites are "heavy" for no reason. By switching to
          hand-crafted code, the entire site is much smaller and faster, there
          is no JavaScript blocking the rendering, and it respects the user's
          data and battery life.
        </p>

        <h3>4. A Personal Connection</h3>
        <p>
          Between being a dad, a husband, and a lifelong
          <strong>SAFC</strong> supporter (a journey that requires a lot of
          resilience), my time is limited. I don't want to spend my weekends
          debugging build problems any more. I want to create content. By
          removing the "middleman," the friction between having an idea and
          publishing it is gone.
