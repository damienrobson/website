        <p>
          For years, my digital presence lived behind the "black box" of
          frameworks. I've chased dependencies, wrestled with build tools, and
          watched <code>node_modules</code> folders grow larger than the actual
          content I was trying to share.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a developer and an <strong>Accessibility Specialist</strong>, I
          finally reached a breaking point. I realized that the more "help" I
          was getting from modern web tooling, the further I was getting from
          the core DNA of the web. Here is why I decided to strip everything
          back to raw HTML and CSS for this living CV.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Accessibility by Intent, Not by Plugin</h2>
        <p>
          In my professional life, I see how easily frameworks can "break" the
          web for users with disabilities. When you use a heavy library, you're
          often fighting its default behaviors to make it accessible. By writing
          raw HTML, I am forced to be intentional. I'm not "fixing" a div to act
          like a button; I'm just using a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code>. There is
          a semantic purity in hand-crafted code that ensures a screen reader
          hears exactly what I intended.
        </p>

        <h2>2. The "Forever" File</h2>
        <p>
          Frameworks have a shelf life. If I build a site in the "Framework of
          the Year," I am effectively putting an expiration date on my content.
          In five years, that framework will be deprecated and the build will
          likely fail. A standard <code>.html</code> file is effectively
          immortal. This site is a "living CV," and I want it to be readable in
          2046 just as easily as it is today.
        </p>

        <h2>3. The Performance of Less</h2>
        <p>
          As a fan of <strong>F1</strong>, I know that weight is the enemy of
          speed. Most modern websites are "heavy" for no reason. By switching to
          hand-crafted code, the entire site is smaller than a single high-res
          photo, there is no JavaScript blocking the rendering, and it respects
          the user's data and battery life.
        </p>

        <h2>4. A Personal Connection</h2>
        <p>
          Between being a dad, a husband, and a lifelong
          <strong>SAFC</strong> supporter (a journey that requires a lot of
          resilience), my time is limited. I don't want to spend my weekends
          debugging a build script just to post a new resource. I want to write.
          By removing the "middleman," the friction between having an idea and
          publishing it is gone.
